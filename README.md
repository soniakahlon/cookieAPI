Summary: This app is for the user with a discerning sweettooth. The app specifically allows the user to search for cookie recipes across the web with the ability to filter their search by: preferred ingredient, number of ingredients, and ingredients to be excluded.  The results for each recipe are rendering in 2 parts: an image of the cookie and a title link to the website with the recipe.
